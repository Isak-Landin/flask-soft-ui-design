# Base template

The base for this template is created by *Creative Tim* along with [Appseed](https://aooseed.us)
The customization for my template and for future project templates (+1000 commits) is created by me - [Isak Landin](https://github.com/Isak-Landin)

- ðŸ‘‰ [HostNodex.com](http://hostnodex.com) - Product page

  # The Idea:
  - Creating a functional open-source template for mass-producing product sites. With a focus on SaaS and IaaS products.
  - Simplify the original project structure to require less to no paywall.
  - Create a flask template that is an actual template, rather than small product page
